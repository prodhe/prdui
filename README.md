## Installation

### Versions

The latest stable version is available at https://github.com/prodhe/prdui.

A bleeding edge development version is available as well (in a separate development branch of the source), but that one may or may not be stable for actual usage.

### Download

Download the zip file and extract the `PrdUI` folder in `World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns`.

While in-game, type `/pui` for options.
